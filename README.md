In this project, I create a portfolio website for myself using Flask with pages for projects, education, and contact information. It allows users to submit contact messages through a form, stores them in an SQLite database, and provides a page to view all submitted messages.

To run this program, you need to run the app.py.
You will see a message in the terminal: "* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000" and put the address in a web browser to view the portfolio website.
